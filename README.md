A simple python chat program
============================

## Quick Summary
1. This program is created to help teach Python to new programmers.
2. This is not designed for security, but for teachability with the idea that it will evolve over time.
3. Yes, we could use a declarative API spec (OpenAPI), but that doesn't teach Python, see above.

## Objectives
1. Create quick Flask API
2. API should support user registration (CRUD)
3. API should support message passing (CRUD) between users
4. API should use local file system storage only.
5. API should run in a container.

## API Specification

### Registration API
* TBD


### Message Passing (Chat) API

## Setup, Build and Deploy
